# FinanceApp

## Description

This project is a flutter app made for educational purposes. I will resume the 2 main purposes of this app as:
- Follow some stocks prices as a watchlist.
- Track your own investments.

## Features

- The app uses the Firebase Authentication service in order to manage users, sign up new users and handle the login system.
- The app uses an internal API I implemented with Node.js and Express.
- The app uses an internal PostgreSQL database to store some information about the users such as the stocks they are following.
- The app also uses an external API to get information about the stocks.
